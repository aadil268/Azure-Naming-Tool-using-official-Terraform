# Base environment (Scenario 1)

# The environment code.  Valid options include dev, prd, qlty, tst, sbx, stg, shd, etc.
environment = "dev"

# Full Azure region name used for deployment (no spaces).  A two‑letter
# location code will be inferred (e.g. 'northeurope' -> 'ne').  Override with
# `location_code_override` if your region isn’t included in the map.

# definitions as needed.  Each suffix list must include the location
# code, environment code and instance number.  The project name is
# prepended automatically.
